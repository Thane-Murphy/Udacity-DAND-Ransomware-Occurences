# Udacity-DAND-Ransomware-Occurences

# Dataset
In this dataset I pulled information from [Ransomwatch](https://ransomwatch.telemetry.ltd/#/recentposts) Wehre information on sites, time and the ransomware groups name was displayed providing insight on what group attacked what asset. This was compared to a [ransomware attacks on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/ransomware-attacks). This data was unstructured and needed a lot of work to be compared to the ransom watch data. I named the data set for ransomwatch RansomPost and the data from Kaggle RansomKaggle. 

# Summary of Findings
The bulk of this project involved data cleaning, constituting 99% of the effort, with only 1% devoted to presentation and analysis. Nonetheless, within this limited scope, I identified Lockbit as the most active ransomware group across both datasets. Interestingly, the analysis revealed a surge in ransomware attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic, likely attributed to increased internet activity as individuals spent more time at home.
